# filewatcher
## a simple auditing utility for macOS

Filewatcher is an auditing and monitoring utility for macOS.

It can audit all events from the system auditpipe of macOS and filter them by process or by file. 
You can use this utility to:
 - Monitor access to a file, or a group of files.
 - Monitor activity of a process, and which resources are accessed by that process.
 - Build a small Host-Based IDS by monitoring access or modifications to specific files.
 - Do an dynamic malware analysis by monitoring what the malware is using on the filesystem.
